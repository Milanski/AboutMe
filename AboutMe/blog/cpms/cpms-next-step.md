# EV SaaS 12-Month Plan 

## Assumptions
- Development effort is **part-time (~10â€“20h/week)** for the next 12 months.
- The system is **almost ready to go live**: it has been running in production for **10 years** and already managed **1,500 company charging stations** successfully.
- Business focus: prepare a demo, attract first pilot customers, and validate market demand.
- We start this as a **side project** to reduce financial risk and because we will need other income sources in the beginning.
- If we see strong customer interest, we are prepared to **switch to full-time** operation.

---

## Why a Side Project First?
- The system is technically mature â†’ we donâ€™t need to invest months of development.
- What we need now is **marketing, demos, and customer pilots**, not heavy coding.
- A demo environment will allow us to showcase the system quickly.
- Operating as a side project keeps **costs very low**, while still generating first revenues.
- Once traction is proven (first paying customers), we can scale into a full company (GmbH).

---

## Strategic Context
- The system has been **in production for 10 years** with proven reliability.
- Already integrated with **1,500 charging stations** at company level.
- Features such as tariffs, reporting, dashboards, and monitoring are already implemented.
- Our task is now **commercialization and scaling**, not building from scratch.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1â€“3)

### Technical
- Clean up codebase: update dependencies, improve maintainability.
- Integrate new payment provider (Stripe/Adyen/PayPal, sandbox).
- Prepare demo system for marketing and customer presentations.

### Business
- Define **tariff model** (buildings & fleets).
- Create landing page + 1-pager intro.
- Identify 5â€“10 pilot customers (buildings, SMEs with EV fleets).

---

## Phase 2: Pilot Preparation (Months 4â€“6)

### Technical
- Deploy demo system on local server or cloud (lean setup).
- Create demo flows (admin dashboard, driver app mock).
- Simulate charging sessions for demos.

### Business
- Approach pilot customers with demo.
- Offer **3-month free trial** for early adopters.
- Collect customer feedback (usability, reporting, pricing).

---

## Phase 3: Pilot Execution & Stabilization (Months 7â€“9)

### Technical
- Stabilize and optimize deployment (CI/CD, monitoring).
- Prepare user documentation and API docs.
- Minor UX/UI improvements (tariff management, reports).

### Business
- Convert **1â€“2 pilots into paying customers**.
- Build partnerships with charger installers (SaaS add-on).
- Publish first case study to show traction.

---

## Phase 4: Growth & Validation (Months 10â€“12)

### Technical
- Add refinements for fleets (home charging reimbursement, export for accounting).
- Strengthen security and GDPR compliance.
- Harden cloud deployment with backups and SLAs.

### Business
- Target **SMEs with 5â€“20 EVs** for fleet pilots.
- Explore partnerships with **leasing companies & EV dealerships**.
- If demand is high â†’ shift from side project â†’ full-time business.
- Prepare investor pitch deck (if expansion needed).

---

## Profit Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Building Managers / Multi-Tenant Houses**
    - Subscription: â‚¬49â€“199/month depending on size (#stations, tenants).
    - Transaction fee: â‚¬0.05 per charging session.

2. **Company Fleets (SMEs)**
    - Subscription: â‚¬149â€“599/month depending on fleet size.
    - Vehicle fee: â‚¬2â€“3 per EV/month.

3. **Optional Add-Ons**
    - White-label branding: â‚¬500 setup.
    - API access for developers: â‚¬99/month.

---

### Cost Structure (Lean Start)
- **Cloud operations**: ~â‚¬450â€“700/month (â‚¬5,400â€“8,400/year).
- **Marketing (website, materials, LinkedIn ads)**: ~â‚¬2kâ€“3k in Year 1.
- **Other (domain, admin, accounting)**: ~â‚¬1kâ€“2k/year.

ðŸ‘‰ Total baseline costs in Year 1: **~â‚¬12k** (very lean).

---

### Profitability Analysis

- Average revenue per charging station: **â‚¬10â€“15/month = ~â‚¬150/year**.
- Yearly costs: **~â‚¬12k**.

**Break-even = ~80 stations.**

#### Scenarios
- **80 stations** â†’ ~â‚¬12k revenue â†’ break-even.
- **200 stations** â†’ ~â‚¬30k revenue â†’ ~â‚¬18k profit.
- **500 stations** â†’ ~â‚¬75k revenue â†’ ~â‚¬63k profit.
- **1,500 stations** (historic level) â†’ ~â‚¬225k revenue â†’ **highly profitable SaaS business**.

ðŸ‘‰ This shows that profitability is achievable with a relatively small number of stations.  
ðŸ‘‰ With access to part of the companyâ€™s already integrated 1,500 stations, we could be profitable from day one.

## Licensing / Gewinnbeteiligung Proposal

Since the company invested in developing the software, we propose the following **license model**:

### Option A: Revenue Share (Recommended)
- We operate the system, cover costs, and commercialize it.
- Company receives **15% of net revenues** (after payment provider fees & cloud hosting).
- Agreement duration: **3 years**, then renegotiation.

### Option B: Hybrid Model
- Small upfront license fee (e.g. â‚¬10kâ€“20k).
- Plus **10% revenue share** for 3 years.
- After 3 years â†’ buyout option (e.g. â‚¬50k or multiple of ARR).

### Option C: Equity Swap
- Instead of revenue share, company gets **5â€“10% equity** in the new venture.
- Works better if we expect VC funding later.

**Recommendation**: Option A (Revenue Share 15% for 3 years) â€“ simple, fair, low risk.

---

## Strategic Opportunity: Leveraging Existing Stations

Our plan is viable with a demo-first approach.  
But there is a **unique opportunity**:

- The system already successfully managed **1,500 company charging stations** for years.
- If the company grants us access to even a **portion of these stations**:
    - We can onboard live customers immediately.
    - Run real payment flows.
    - Generate early revenues from day one.
    - Stronger business case for scaling & GmbH formation.

---

## GmbH Formation â€“ Timing Proposal

- GmbH setup in Germany costs **~â‚¬25k capital + legal/admin costs**.
- We propose a **phased approach**:
    1. **Short-term (0â€“12 months):** Operate lean under personal/freelance setup with revenue share.
    2. **Mid-term (12â€“24 months):** Once >â‚¬50k ARR or >5 customers are reached â†’ establish GmbH.
    3. Company can be invited as a **minor shareholder** if desired.

This ensures we **minimize upfront cost & risk**, while focusing on proving traction first.

---

## Summary

- System is **technically ready**: proven in production for 10 years, 1,500 stations integrated.
- We start as a **side project** for cost efficiency and to build a demo for marketing.
- Profit model is clear: low costs (~â‚¬12k/year) + scalable subscriptions.
- Break-even with only **80 stations**, very achievable.
- Strong upside: with 200â€“500 stations â†’ profitable, with 1,500 â†’ six-figure SaaS.
- Company benefits immediately via **revenue share** (15%).
- If existing stations are opened to us, revenue can start immediately.
- GmbH will follow once revenue justifies it.

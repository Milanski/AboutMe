I am consistently impressed by his architectural vision and technical leadership. He is a reliable engineer who has always been a valuable resource, particularly when it comes to complex architectural and solution design challenges. He has demonstrated his ability to lead and deliver on architectural initiatives by guiding multiple teams in implementing Domain-Driven Design. He was instrumental during the challenging migration of a legacy code refactoring project and also actively mentored multiple teams on this subject. This not only significantly improved the system stability but also ensured a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot version 3 was possible. He implemented Spring context cache reuse for our tests, effectively resolving a very big performance bottleneck. This resulted in a 90% reduction in pipeline execution times and a significant improvement in developer productivity and efficiency across multiple teams. His ability to translate complex technical concepts into practical solutions makes him an ideal candidate for a Software or Solution Architect role.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Congratulations!","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/AboutMe/docs/Tutorials/congratulations","content":"Congratulations!","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"About Me","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/AboutMe/docs/intro","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Personal Info","type":1,"pageTitle":"About Me","url":"/AboutMe/docs/intro##","content":" { &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Milancho&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Panovski&quot;, &quot;ReleaseDate&quot;: &quot;1985-10-03&quot;, &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;: &quot;Stuttgart, Germany&quot;, &quot;Status&quot;: &quot;Married&quot; }   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Career","type":1,"pageTitle":"About Me","url":"/AboutMe/docs/intro##","content":"  Senior Software Architect (01.2019 - Today) Bosch Mobility GmbH, Feuerbach Cross-Domain ConceptsEvent-Driven-ArchitectureMicroservicesMentoringRelease ManagementStakeholder SynchronisationDocumentation  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Education","type":1,"pageTitle":"About Me","url":"/AboutMe/docs/intro##","content":" From - To\tWhat\tWhere2004 - 2008\tComputer Systems and Technologies\tTechnical Uni - Sofia 2008 - 2011\tComputer Systems and Technologies\tTechnical Uni - Sofia  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Skills","type":1,"pageTitle":"About Me","url":"/AboutMe/docs/intro##","content":"  Documentation arc42DocusaurusMarkdownAsciiDocSwaggerUIOpenApiRestDocsPlantUML Methodology/Concepts UML 2Open API Specification (OAS)Domain Driven Design (DDD)Object Oriented DesignData Oriented DesignDesign PatternsArchitectural Patterns Architecture MicroservicesEvent-Driven-ArchitectureLayered Architecture     Programming Languages JavaJavaScript Spoken Languages GermanEnglishSerbo-CroatianBulgarianMacedonian Testing JUnitMockitoPowerMockWiremockRestAssuredTestcontainersArchUnit Database OracleRedisMongoDBPostgreSQLMySQL     Cloud/Containerization DockerHelmKubernetesAzureAWS VCS SVNGitHub Monitoring GrafanaUptrendsSplunk  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Hobbies","type":1,"pageTitle":"About Me","url":"/AboutMe/docs/intro##","content":"  Sportive SoccerGymJogging ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}

Executive Summary\\n- **Objective**: Acquire the source code of the CPMS solution (OCPP 1.6 and 2.0.1 compliant, including tariff portal for dynamic pricing) to launch a side project targeting small CPOs and building managers.\\n- **Vision**: Build a scalable, interoperable EV charging platform with a focus on partnerships and collaboration.\\n- **Value Proposition**: Revive a discontinued project, generate new revenue streams, and support the growing EV charging market without vendor lock-in.\\n- **Win-Win**: Offer the company licensing fees or equity in the new venture in exchange for the source code.\\n\\n##  3. Market Opportunity\\n- **EV Charging Growth**:\\n  - Public charging points in the EU are expected to double from ~630,000 in 2023 to over 2 million by 2030 under current policies (IEA)\\n  - In Germany alone, the number of public EV chargers is expected to grow from around 125,000 today to between 450,000 and 565,000 by 2030, driven by rising EV adoption and national targets.\\n- **Target Market**:\\n  - **Small CPOs**: Local operators managing 10\u2013100 charging stations, seeking cost-effective, interoperable solutions.\\n  - **Building Managers**: Residential and commercial property managers needing EV charging for tenants/employees.\\n- **Gap**: Small players often face high costs and vendor lock-in with proprietary systems. OCPP-compliant solutions ensure flexibility and scalability.[](https://chargelab.co/industry-advocacy/ocpp)\\n- **Dynamic Pricing**: Tariff portal enables competitive pricing models, attracting cost-conscious customers.\\n\\n##  4. Why the CPMS Solution?\\n- **Technical Strengths**:\\n  - Supports **OCPP 1.6** (widely adopted, JSON-based, smart charging) and **OCPP 2.0.1** (advanced security, device management, ISO 15118 Plug & Charge).[](https://tridenstechnology.com/ocpp-protocol/)[](https://monta.com/en/blog/upgrade-to-ocpp-2-0-1/)\\n  - Tariff portal for dynamic pricing, enabling real-time adjustments based on grid demand and energy costs.\\n  - Cloud-based, scalable architecture for remote monitoring, billing, and load management.[](https://www.ampeco.com/ev-charging-glossary/cpms-charge-point-management-system/)\\n- **Current Status**: Discontinued by the company, but fully functional and market-ready with minor updates.\\n- **Competitive Edge**: Hardware-agnostic, supports over 450 charger models, and avoids vendor lock-in.[](https://www.virta.global/blog/station-management-platform-for-cpos)\\n\\n##  5. Our Vision\\n- **Side Project Launch**:\\n  - Start small, targeting local CPOs and building managers.\\n  - Test market interest with a lean MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach.\\n  - Leverage existing codebase to minimize development costs.\\n- **Scalability**:\\n  - Expand to larger CPOs and regional markets based on demand.\\n  - Integrate OCPP 2.1 features (e.g., V2G, DER control) as market evolves.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Charge_Point_Protocol)\\n- **Partnerships**:\\n  - Collaborate with hardware vendors, energy providers, and e-mobility service providers (eMSPs).\\n  - Offer white-label solutions for building managers to brand as their own.\\n\\n##  6. Business Model\\n- **Revenue Streams**:\\n  - **Subscription-Based CPMS**: Monthly fees for cloud-based management (monitoring, billing, load management).\\n  - **Dynamic Pricing Module**: Transaction-based fees for tariff portal usage.\\n  - **Consulting Services**: Setup and integration support for CPOs and building managers.\\n  - **Partnership Royalties**: Revenue-sharing with hardware vendors or eMSPs.\\n- **Cost Structure**:\\n  - Initial development: Minimal, using existing source code.\\n  - Hosting: Cloud-based (e.g., AWS IoT Core for OCPP integration).[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/building-an-ocpp-compliant-electric-vehicle-charge-point-operator-solution-using-aws-iot-core/)\\n  - Marketing: Targeted outreach to local CPOs and property managers.\\n- **Pricing**: Affordable tiers for small operators (e.g., $50\u2013$200/month based on charger count).\\n\\n##  7. Partnership Model (Win-Win)\\n- **For Small CPOs**:\\n  - **Benefits**: Interoperable, OCPP-compliant software reduces dependency on proprietary systems. Dynamic pricing maximizes revenue.[](https://www.ampeco.com/blog/6-things-charge-point-operator-ocpp-2-0-1/)\\n  - **Model**: Revenue-sharing (e.g., 20% of transaction fees) or flat subscription fees.\\n- **For Building Managers**:\\n  - **Benefits**: Attract tenants with EV charging, manage energy costs via smart charging, and offer branded user interfaces.\\n  - **Model**: White-label CPMS with profit-sharing on charging revenue (e.g., 30% to building manager, 70% to us).\\n- **For Hardware Vendors**:\\n  - **Benefits**: Integration with our CPMS increases their hardware\u2019s appeal.[](https://www.virta.global/blog/station-management-platform-for-cpos)\\n  - **Model**: Co-marketing agreements or referral fees for hardware sales.\\n- **For eMSPs**:\\n  - **Benefits**: Seamless roaming integrations for broader network access.[](https://www.virta.global/de/blog/ueberblick-ueber-das-cpo-backend-von-virta)\\n  - **Model**: Per-transaction fees for roaming services.\\n\\n##  8. Proposal to the Company\\n- **Why Share the Source Code?**:\\n  - Revive a discontinued asset, generating new value without additional company investment.\\n  - Avoid sunk costs of an unused codebase.\\n  - Aligns with industry trends toward open standards and interoperability.[](https://chargelab.co/industry-advocacy/ocpp)\\n- **Proposed Terms**:\\n  - **Option 1: Equity Stake**: Offer 5\u201310% equity in the new venture for full source code ownership.\\n  - **Option 2: Revenue Share**: Share 10\u201320% of net profits with the company for 3\u20135 years.\\n- **Benefits to Company**:\\n  - Financial return without operational overhead.\\n  - Potential for future collaboration or acquisition.\\n\\n##  9.
